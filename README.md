# scala-leetcode

There are plenty of leetcode solutions on Discuss page. However, a few (or sometimes none) of them are in Scala. 
This repo is just a collection of my own solutions in Scala. Some questions on leetcode can be solved nicely in a functional way too even though it does not seem that intuitive in the first place.

Comments and suggestions are very welcome :)
